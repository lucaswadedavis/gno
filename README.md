## GNO
is for keeping notes on a git repo with a single terminal command

## Usage
gno "Heading and Git Commit Message" "body of the note"

The command above will add a new note to this readme file commit the changes and push the updated repo to Github, provided the gno function (in that .gnoBash file) has been added to your .bashrc file and the path to your own gno repo has been substituted for mine.
